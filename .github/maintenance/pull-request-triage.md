# Pull Request Triage

The purpose of pull request triage is to ensure that pull requests are reviewed and merged in a timely manner.

## Process

The process is managed by the grant facilitator.

### Labelling

The facilitator goes through all open pull requests and checks for the following:

- Is the pull request in the right repository?
- Does it contain all the required information?
- Has the team provided sufficient background information?

If any of the above is not true, the facilitator will request an update from the team and label the pull request with `waiting-for-team`. If the pull request is fine, they will label it with `ready-for-review`.

### Follow-ups

The facilitator will follow up on any pull request that is `waiting-for-team` for more than 2 weeks. If there is no response, the pull request will be closed.

### Review

Once a pull request is `ready-for-review`, the facilitator will ping the committee members and ask them to review it.

### Merging

Once at least 2 committee members have approved the pull request, the facilitator will merge it. If there are any conflicts, the facilitator will ask the team to resolve them.
