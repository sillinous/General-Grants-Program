# Backlog Grooming

The purpose of backlog grooming is to keep the backlog up-to-date and to ensure that the program committee can make quick decisions.

## Process

The process is managed by the grant facilitator.

### Labelling

The facilitator goes through all open applications and checks for the following:

- Is the application in the right repository?
- Does it contain all the required information?
- Are the costs reasonable?
- Has the team provided sufficient background information?

If any of the above is not true, the facilitator will request an update from the team and label the application with `waiting-for-team`. If the application is fine, they will label it with `ready-for-review`.

### Follow-ups

The facilitator will follow up on any application that is `waiting-for-team` for more than 2 weeks. If there is no response, the application will be closed.

### Review

Once an application is `ready-for-review`, the facilitator will ping the committee members and ask them to review it.

### Voting

The committee members will vote on the application. The vote can be either "approve" or "reject". A vote is only valid if it is accompanied by a reason.

Once at least 3 committee members have voted and there is a majority, the facilitator will proceed with the decision. If there is no majority after 1 week, the facilitator will ask the remaining committee members to vote. If there is still no majority after 2 weeks, the application will be rejected.

### Decision

If the application is approved, the facilitator will:

- label the application with `accepted`,
- move the application to the `accepted_grant_applications.md` file,
- reply to the application and congratulate the team,
- ask the team to provide their payment information.

If the application is rejected, the facilitator will:

- label the application with `rejected`,
- close the application,
- reply to the application and provide the reason for the rejection.
